# Market-Segmentation-for-Online-Vehicle-Booking

# Fermi Estimation (Breakdown of Problem Statement)
In the dynamic landscape of India's vehicle booking service sector, this project aims to revolutionize revenue generation through astute market segmentation. Leveraging segmentation analysis, the startup seeks to identify untapped market niches and tailor its services to meet the unique needs of discerning customer segments. By contemplating strategic partnerships, value-added services, and a foray into untapped territories, the startup envisions disrupting the established vehicle booking industry.
# Data Sources
Datasets were collected from database websites such as Kaggle, each with different parameters relating to car booking services.
# Data Pre-processing (Steps and Libraries Used)
Data pre-processing involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding alphanumerical data. The primary module used for data management was the Pandas library.
# Segment Extraction (ML Techniques Used)
The main focus of the code is on applying the K-means clustering algorithm to identify distinct segments based on features like 'hour,' 'status,' and 'pickup point.' Visualization tools like histograms and pie charts were utilized for a comprehensive understanding.
# Profiling and Describing Potential Segments
Potential segments were profiled based on time-related attributes, trip statuses, pickup points, cluster information, demand-supply gap, and various visualizations. Insights derived help in understanding patterns, identifying issues, and ultimately segmenting the data for further analysis and targeted strategies.
# Selection of Target Segment
The selection of the target segment involves a holistic analysis of both provided codes, emphasizing completion rates, low cancellation rates, and unique user preferences. A balanced approach is recommended, aligning with the company's goals and enhancing marketing strategies.
# Customizing the Marketing Mix
While the first code provides insights into potential segments, the second code, with its clustering analysis, offers an explicit opportunity to customize the marketing mix based on identified clusters. Targeting specific user behaviors can enhance the effectiveness of marketing strategies.
# Potential Customer Base in the Early Market
The potential market size and revenue for a vehicle booking service in India are estimated, considering factors like population, smartphone usage, and ride-hailing service adoption.
# The Most Optimal Market Segments to Open
Optimal market segments are identified by combining insights from both codes. Frequent completed trips and user behaviors within these segments align with characteristics identified through a combination of both codes.
